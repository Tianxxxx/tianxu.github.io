  abstract = {Learning personalized self-management routines is pivotal for peoplewith type 1 diabetes (T1D),
  particularly early in diagnosis.Context-aware technologies, such as hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulinpumps,
  are important tools for diabetes self-management.However, clinicians have observed that practices using
  these technologiesinvolve significant individual differences.
  We conductedinterviews with 20 adolescents and young adults who use HCLinsulin pump systems for managing T1D,
  and we found that these individuals leverage both technological and non-technologicalmeans to maintain
  situational awareness about their condition.We discuss how these practices serve to infrastructure their selfmanagementroutines,
  including medical treatment, diet, and glucosemeasurement-monitoring routines. Our study provides insightsinto adolescents‚Äô and young adults‚Äô
  lived experiences ofusing HCL systems and related technology to manage diabetes,and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of
  how the HCI community can support the contextualized management of diabetesthrough technology design.},

  abstract = {Personal informatics (PI) systems have been developed to support reflection. While reflection is considered an indispensable activity in PI use, how and when reflection occurs is still under-studied. In this paper, we present an analysis of the interactive features of 123 commercial PI apps, revealing that reflective practices are unevenly supported. The lack of features that encourage user-driven reflection, scaffolding for setting goals and configuring data collection and presentation, and consideration of wider implications stand to limit meaning-making and frustrate nuanced insight generation based on lived experiences. Based on our findings, we discuss how reflection is currently misrepresented in personal informatics tools, identify and characterize the gaps between theoretical research on reflection and interface features in current apps, and offer suggestions about how reflection could be better supported.},
