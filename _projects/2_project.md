I am interested in understanding how context-aware health technology can better support human-machine collaboration, aiding people's seamless routines between health management and other everyday activities. Motivated by this interest, I examine contextualized health management from STS perspective and offer insights into context-aware technology design.

Context-aware technologies, such as hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pumps, are important tools for diabetes self-management. From the perspective of infrastructure and infrastructuring, we found that young people leverage both technological and non-technological means to maintain situational awareness about their health condition. I served as a research assistant for this NIH-supported project.
