I love calligraphy, particularly traditional Chinese calligraphy. I’m also obsessed with the creation of combining its aesthetics with other things, generating new and inspiring meanings, such as the artwork of [Book from the Sky](https://www.xubing.com/en/exhibition/details/419?year=2016) by the Chinese artist [Xu Bing (徐冰)](https://www.xubing.com/).*(My _very simple_ description is: writing English letters using the style of Chinese calligraphy and combining them to form words)*.

Just sharing a piece :)

Inspired by his creation and NüShu (script created by and used by women in Southern China. An example introduction can be found [here](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200930-nshu-chinas-secret-female-only-language)), I practiced writing my first name in English–Tian (甜 in Chinese, which is my last name).

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/nameLogo.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"%}
  </div>
</div>

The left part of this writing piece adapts 女 (woman) from Nüshu to represent my gender. The middle and right parts adapt from Xu Bing's *Book from the Sky*, calligraphized T, I, A, and N.
