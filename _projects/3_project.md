The projects drew inspiration from ethnographic methods. I employed short-term fieldwork, interviews, and observations to explore offline grocery shopping experiences in Boulder and learning/entertainment experiences at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We conducted iterative thematic analysis of diverse data sources (e.g., field notes, pictures, videos, and transcripts). We further provided  design recommendations improving future graduate students' shopping and museum visitors' experiences.
