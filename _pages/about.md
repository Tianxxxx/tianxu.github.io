Tian is a third-year Ph.D. student at CU Boulder, advised by [Dr. Stephen Voida](https://stephen.voida.com/), a member of [TMI (Too Much Information) lab](https://tmilab.colorado.edu/), and a research affiliate of [IRL (Internet Rules Lab) directed by Dr. Casey Fiesler](https://www.internetruleslab.com/). Tian's research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, health informatics, and design, centering on understanding technology ecosystem and personal health infrastructure mediating mental and physical health management in peopleâ€™s day-to-day life, designing novel context-aware health support technology or systems (e.g., algorithm-enhanced health technology), and examining lived experiences with health technology, data, and AI from STS perspectives. She is also interested in studying privacy concerns over health technology use. Before joining [INFO](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience) at CU Boulder, she earned a M.S. in information management at Syracuse University.
